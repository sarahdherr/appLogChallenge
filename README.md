# Sarah Herr's Coding Challenge
Welcome to Sarah's coding challenge submission! It is built with Node, Sequelize and Express.

## Machine Setup:
- Install and run Postgres (version 9.6), including the `psql` command line tool (you can download it at http://postgresapp.com/).
- Install node (version 7.8.0)
- Install npm (version 4.2.0)

## Run the code:
After cloning the repo to your local machine and are in the folder, run the following commands:
1. `npm install`
2. `createdb sarah-herr-log-challenge`
3. `npm start`

## Test it:
Once set up, go to http://localhost:8080/api/test/read. Here you can see the response of the section of app.log data I was working with. It has also populated the database in the corresponding tables.
